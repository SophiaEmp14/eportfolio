        <h1>My Screen Printing Process</h1>
	<h3>By: Sophia Empric</h3>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
	<p>In our New Media and Tech Class we did a Screenprinting Project using many different resources and tools. We learned how to use Adobe Photoshop which is used for editing pictures and merging simple images. In this project, we got to use a total of 1-3 colors for our final project. We started by first getting to know the app and then starting our main project. We learned many new things and got to answer many questions. While in this process we also got to use cameras to take pictures of our progress throughout the project.</p>

	<h2>My Idea Process</h2>
	<p>The first thing I did to pick my idea to use as a drawing for my final project was brainstorming things I like or find interesting in life. Once I got my final three ideas I picked my favorite idea from the three and decided that would be my design for the overall project. I wanted to use something that symbolizes relaxation and being in a calm state of mind. Thatâ€™s where I came up with the idea of using a flower in my design. I also wanted my design to include my hands so I combined the two and came up with me holding the flower up in the air to make it float. </p>

	<h2>Photography</h2>
	<p>	After I had a basic layout for my project we started taking pictures of our process and hand gestures. We got to use professional cameras to capture our work and we learned how to use them and take pictures from different angles. Using the camera I was able to capture the main part of my project which was my hands. I used my hands to make a semi-circle so I could photoshop a flower inside. I had my teammate help me take these pictures and made sure the center of attention was on my hands.</p>
	<h2>Editing</h2>
	<p>After I finished taking all my pictures I started editing them on Adobe Photoshop to add my flower and to add some filters to my original photos. To start I added my hand picture that I took with the camera and sized it to my liking then started changing the color and adding some filters. Then I looked up a picture of a lotus flower and picked my favorite one and added it to my design. Once I added it to my project on Adobe I changed the size and the placement to where I wanted it to be. Then change the color to be all pink and add a little filter on top. Then I finalized my design so I could start making my actual 3D screenprint.</p>

	<h2>Physical Screen Preparation</h2>
	<p>To make our physical screen we had to use materials like wood, a stapler, a ruler, a pencil, wood glue, an iron, a hammer, and a saw. First, we measured out our wood so it could fit our design inside but still have extra space. Once we finished this step we were able to move on by actually using a saw to cut out our wood so we could start assembling our frames. To put our frame together we used wood glue to hold them together and then used a stapler for extra support so nothing would break. We continued these steps until we had a complete frame for our project. After we made our frames we printed out a stencil of our design on vinyl, we carefully removed pieces of the vinyl that were not needed in the design. After we ironed the stencil to our frames so we could be prepared to start painting. I started by mixing my paints to make a light pink by using more white than red to get the perfect color I wanted for my design. After I placed my frame on a piece of paper and carefully added paint to my frame I started moving the paint around the frame to print out my design on the paper. Once it came out how I liked it I printed my design on a box for my final project.</p>

	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>The thing I mostly enjoyed about this project was being able to finally print out my final design with paint on paper and a box to see all my hard work pay off in the end. I would say the most challenging part was building the actual frame for my project, as it was difficult to get the correct measurements without messing up or having the pieces not going together correctly. However, my teammates were able to help me make sure all my measurements were correct and that all my pieces were equal and fit together to make a nice frame. I was able to demonstrate my 21st Century Competency by communicating and collaborating with others by effectively working productively with others to help complete their project. I was able to help my teammates staple their frames together so nothing would get messed up or crooked in their final design. I was so able to help others use Photoshop if they were confused or missed any step. This showed good collaboration and leadership as I took it upon myself to give up some of my work time to help others who could have been confused or needed simple help. In conclusion, this was a very fun and good learning experience as I was able to learn new skills not only on the computer but in real life as well.</p>
