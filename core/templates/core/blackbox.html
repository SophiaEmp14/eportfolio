<h1>Black Box Investigation</h1>
<h3>by Sophia Empric</h3>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>In our New Media and Tech Class, we were given the challenge to get a better understanding of what's inside the Mystery Black Box. The Mystery Black Box is a big box that we used to insert water to see how much would come out. After that, we made our own version of the Mystery Black Box and recorded data as well.</p>

<h2>CLAIM</h2>
<p>What is inside the black box to make it release a certain amount of water?</p>
<p>I believe there are two separate tubes that split then later get released from the box.<p>
<h2>EVIDENCE</h2>
<p>The mystery black box is a box that you input water into a funnel at the top to see the outcome once it comes out but it did unexpected things instead. Instead of the same amount of water being inputted there would be a different outcome every trial. One trial no water would come out while in another a whole bunch of water would be released, leaving everyone to wonder what’s inside.</p>
<p>We used this same method in our model but instead of two tubes we decided to use two buckets. So it would have a similar effect to what we believe is inside the box. The results from our model to the actual Black box were semi-similar. They both did not release a lot of water the first trial and then release a lot the next and it would be on and off. But ours tend to leak and spill water while the water was making its way to be released. Causing most of our water to not be released in the end, which is also similar to the real black box since not all of it’s water would get released in general.</p>

<h2>REASONING</h2>
<p>The models are used to represent our ideas of what could possibly be inside the box. This was able to test our ideas to see if our claim was correct, or even if they were on the right track and to see what we should improve. There are both strengths and limitations when it came to proving out theory correct. By limiting our ideas or being able to think outside the box and create new ideas.</p>
<p>My claim is correct because it is able to logically prove how there is a delay and why more water comes out than other times. To prove this claim there is enough data on my data chart to show how I was correct.</p>
<p>Another way for this to happen would be making a wheel inside that held cups. This would be able to release some water but also have some water get caught in the cup until it overflows. Proving the delay and how sometimes more water or less water comes out from the box.</p>

<h2>Our 3D Art Work:</h2>
<p> After making our physical model we used the app Autodesk MAYA to create an online visul of our model. Before creating our final model we practiced using MAYA by using the game pictionary in order to perfect our skills.  </p>
<h2> Here are some examples of my Pictionary designs on MAYA- </h2>

<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<p>During our 3D model we havd to learn new skills some were easy and some were difficult. To make it easier we created a team contract in order to get everything completed. We took turns finishing different parts of the model so later we can make it 3D online. We used many different materials to create our physical model and it ended up working in some way. After completing this we switched from working by hand to working online. When working online we had to learn how to use the app MAYA in order to complete this task. It was fun and difficult but overall it was a cool app to use.</p>

<h2>21st Century Competency:</h2>
<p>For my 21st Century Competency skill I was able to demonstrate "Creativity and Innovation". Specifically demonstrating originality and inventiveness throughout my project and website. As I created my own color palette and fonts for the website. This was able to make my website unique because nobody else used the same ideas as I did. This also gave me some setbacks on how I wanted my wedsite to look aesthetically and presentable. But after these setbacks my website and over project came out great.
